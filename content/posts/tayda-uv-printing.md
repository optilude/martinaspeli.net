[Tayda Electronics](https://www.taydaelectronics.com) is an online electronics store in Thailand, which is popular with guitar pedal builders for supplying both components and hardware for DIY and hobby projects. I have built many pedal from [Jeds Peds](https://www.jedspeds.co.uk), who sell a bewildering array of PCB pedal kits and has a great community on Facebook.

The kits arrive by default with unpainted enclosures, which you can decorate yourself, and that's part of the fun. Most people use spray painting and home-printed waterslide decals for this, but after my first batch of pedals, I decided that painting is my least favourite part of the process. It requires a level of patience and consistency that I don't possess, is sensitive to temperature and humidiy, and makes a mess. And more importantly, even with base coats, multiple colour coats, and clear top coats, my pedals all chip and ding too quickly.

There are better ways. Commercial enclosures will commonly be power-coated, which is more durable, and will have any designs printed on them directly, rather than applied via a decal. And Tayda has a service that lets you do both. It's not _entirely_ obvious how it works, though, so here is my attempt at documenting the process. I learned all of this form others, in particular [this tutorial](https://www.pachydermpedals.com/tutorials/2020-12-27-angry-charles-tutorial/), [this forum thread](https://forum.pedalpcb.com/threads/steggo-studios-tayda-uv-printing-tutorial-part-1.15268/), and [this video series](https://youtu.be/iH_k_C3WFLU?si=40jGqZ2HyuiLko-G), as well as advice and examples from David Summers of the Jeds Peds forum.
